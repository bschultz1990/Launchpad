# Launchpad
This is a work-related app to help relieve copy and paste strain and help you focus on getting work done.
This was made special for the hard-working online team at Earth Sense Energy Systems. You guys rock! ♥️

# Disclaimer
This software comes with no warranty. If you hit the wrong button, you will make Evosus spaz out. At best, I've had to close some random dialog boxes.  At worst, I've had a payment entered prematurely. This software is optional. If you intend to use it, please be aware of the risks.

This software copies and pastes sensitive data such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, it does not store this data. After you close Launchpad, it forgets the order data entirely. You are welcome to [refer to this project's main page](https://github.com/bschultz1990/Launchpad/) and scrutinize my code to verify this. Any pictures in this guide or code in this repository have obsured or faked names, addresses, phone numbers, order numbers, and payment method numbers in order to protect privacy.

# Known Issues
These are either quirks of the AutoIt programming language and/or are unable to be worked around at this time.
- Launchpad will  force focus on the windows it's working on. This means you can not reliably work in one window while it's dealing with a different one. Wait for it to finish, then click on stuff later. ;)
