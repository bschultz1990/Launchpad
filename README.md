# Launchpad
This is a work-related app to help relieve copy and paste strain and help you focus on getting work done.
This was made special for the hard-working online team at Earth Sense Energy Systems. You guys rock! ♥️

# Disclaimer
This software comes with no warranty. If you hit the wrong button, you will make Evosus spaz out. At best, I've had to close some random dialog boxes.  At worst, I've had a payment entered prematurely. This software is optional. If you intend to use it, please be aware of the risks.

This software copies and pastes sensitive data such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, it does not store this data. After you close Launchpad, it forgets the order data entirely. [Here is my code]() so you can verify.

# Installation
Grab the release from the [Releases page](). Unzip wherever you'd like to put it and run.

Prerequisites
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- ShipWorks
- Evosus

# Setup
Open up ShipWorks. Right-click on your column headers.

Make sure you have the following headers **in this exact order:**

You may add other column headers afterwards, but the first 21 must look _exactly_ like the picture above. Otherwise, Launchpad will be very confused.

# Tweaking Addresses
Before importing an order from ShipWorks, make sure its address is correctly formatted. In order to make lasting changes that Launchpad will also understand, DO NOT change anything on the Shipping panel to the right as you may be used to. These changes are not permanent:

# Usage
Launchpad stays on top of all other windows. Open it and move it wherever it's out of the way. When you're ready, hit the "Import Order" button.

Here, Launchpad will be looking for your order info. Head to ShipWorks, right-click on the order you want to copy, select "Copy," then "Copy Row." Alternatively, you can left-click on an order and hit `Ctrl+c`.

Right-click on the text field in Launchpad's window and hit "Paste." Alternatively, you can left-click on this text field and hit `Ctrl+v`.

Click "OK".

From here, Launchpad will look different depending on what platform your order is from. From left to right is Pellethead.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and eBay.com:
