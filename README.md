# Launchpad
This is a work-related app to help relieve copy and paste strain and help you focus on getting work done.
This was made special for the hard-working online team at Earth Sense Energy Systems. You guys rock! ♥️

# Disclaimer
This software comes with no warranty. If you hit the wrong button, you will make Evosus spaz out. At best, I've had to close some random dialog boxes.  At worst, I've had a payment entered prematurely. This software is optional. If you intend to use it, please be aware of the risks.

This software copies and pastes sensitive data such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, it does not store this data. After you close Launchpad, it forgets whatever data it was working with. For the sceptics, my code is open source so you can look yourself.

# Installation
Grab the release from the [Releases page](). Unzip wherever you'd like to put it and run.

Prerequisites
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- ShipWorks
- Evosus

# Setup
Open up ShipWorks. Right-click on your column headers.

Make sure you have the following headers **in this exact order:**

You may add other column headers afterwards, but the first 21 must look _exactly_ like the picture above. Otherwise, Launchpad will be very confused.

# Usage
Launchpad stays on top of all other windows. Open it and move it wherever it's out of the way. When you're ready, hit the "Import Order" button.
