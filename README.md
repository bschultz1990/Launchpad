# Launchpad
This is a work-related app to help relieve copy and paste strain and help you focus on getting work done.
This was made special for the hard-working online team at Earth Sense Energy Systems. You guys rock! ♥️

# Disclaimer
This software comes with no warranty. If you hit the wrong button, you will make Evosus spaz out. At best, I've had to close some random dialog boxes.  At worst, I've had a payment entered prematurely. This software is optional. If you intend to use it, please be aware of the risks.

This software copies and pastes sensitive data such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, it does not store this data. After you close Launchpad, it forgets the order data entirely. [Here is my code]() so you can verify. Any pictures in this guide or code in this repository have obsured or faked names, addresses, phone numbers, order numbers, and payment method numbers in order to protect privacy.

# Installation
Grab the release from the [Releases page](). Unzip wherever you'd like to put it and run.

Prerequisites
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- ShipWorks
- Evosus

# Setup
Open up ShipWorks. Right-click on your column headers.

Make sure you have the following headers **in this exact order:**

You may add other column headers afterwards, but the first 21 must look _exactly_ like the picture above. Otherwise, Launchpad will be very confused.

## Tweaking Addresses
Before importing an order from ShipWorks, make sure its address is correctly formatted. In order to make lasting changes that Launchpad will also understand, DO NOT change anything on the Shipping panel to the right as you may be used to:

![address_bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19655298/153064409-9ccc7802-b488-487d-b69e-a253382b2127.PNG)

Instead, double-click on the order, hit "Address" and then "Edit." Make your changes here. Be sure to validate the address and take any suggestions before hitting "OK" and saving your progress:

After this, your Shipping panel will also say it needs to validate your changes. It does not. If you've modified the address by double-clicking, you can safely ignore this message.

> **Note:** Unfortunately, this is more involved than tweaking the address on the Shipping panel. Since it can be jarring to flip between address fixing and order entry, I suggest tweaking a handful of addresses first, then entering those orders afterwards.
