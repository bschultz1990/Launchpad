# Launchpad
This is a work-related app to help relieve copy and paste strain and help you focus on getting work done.
This was made special for the hard-working online team at Earth Sense Energy Systems. You guys rock! ♥️

# Installation
Grab the release from the [Releases page](). Unzip wherever you'd like to put it and run.

Prerequisites
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

# Setup
Open up ShipWorks. Right-click on your column headers and make sure you have the following headers **in this exact order:**

You may add other column headers afterwards, but the first 21 must look _exactly_ like the picture above. Otherwise, Launchpad will not know where to put names and address lines, for example.
